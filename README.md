Module 13 Challenge: Mapping_Earthquakes

In this module, we assisted Basil and Sadhana in creating an interactive earthquake map which allows users to view three separate layers:

1. Recent earthquakes (past week)
2. Tectonic plate locations
3. Major earthquakes (recent earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5 or greater).

The three layers can all be separately turned on or off using the menu in the top right of the page. For all three layers, the objects can be clicked in order to view more infomation. The earthquake circles will provide the location and the magnitude of the earthquake, while the fault lines will give you more information regarding the line's name. 

Finally, we have added three different maps that the data can be viewed on. The three types include "light" and "dark" street views and a satellite view.
